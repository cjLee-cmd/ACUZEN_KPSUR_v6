Dear PV Team,

This is to inform you that during the current reporting period (November 2021 to October 2022), there were NO changes to the safety reference information concerning COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA (including but not limited to: contraindications, warnings, precautions, adverse drug reactions, overdosage, and drug interactions).

The product information documentation remained consistent throughout this interval, and no regulatory-mandated or company-initiated modifications to safety-related sections were implemented.

This status confirms that the currently authorized product information remains consistent with the latest regulatory guidance and clinical evidence available during this period.

Should any safety-related updates become necessary in future periods, timely notification will be provided to your department.

Thank you for your attention.
